### Project Description ###

An app geared towards sneaker collectors or anyone who likes and wants to catalogue the different sneakers they own. Users has to make an account before they can use the services, but once they do they are able to do a number of things. Once logged in they are able to create a collection list of all the sneakers they own, their pricing, description, picture and a little review of it. Home menu will have the top must have's for that specific season and year. User can interact with giving it a like and adding it to their list if they own it.


**Expected Challenges**


* Authorization and authentication part of this application would be the most challenging. 

* Creating the CRUD functionality and the specific routes associated with the various parts of the project.

* Connecting the Rails back-end with the React front-end.

First page user is greeted with a login/register form.

Once logged in, registerd they will go to homepage where top of the navbar will be the name of the app.

Home page will showcase top 10 favorite picks of the season and or year (haven't decided yet).

User can interact with top 10 by giving a like and if they have it add it to their collection page.

The user builds this collection by adding specific sneakers to it.

View collection brings them to all the items in their collection.

Each item in the collection would have a name, brand, price, image, description, and review section.

When adding user will be prompt with a form that will ask for name, brand, price, image, description and review of the sneaker being added.
